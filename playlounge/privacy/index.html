                    <h3>8. Data Security</h3>
                    <p>Although we collect minimal data, we still implement strong security measures:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Encrypted Connections:</strong> All communication between your device and our server uses HTTPS/TLS encryption</li>
                        <li><strong>WebSocket Security:</strong> Secure WebSocket (WSS) connections for real-time gameplay</li>
                        <li><strong>No Persistent Storage:</strong> Session-only data reduces risk of data breaches</li>
                        <li><strong>Server Security:</strong> Fly.io infrastructure provides DDoS protection and secure hosting</li>
                        <li><strong>Token Expiration:</strong> Session tokens automatically expire after 24 hours</li>
                        <li><strong>Room Code Expiration:</strong> Temporary room codes expire after 5 minutes</li>
                        <li><strong>No Central Database:</strong> We don't maintain databases of user information, eliminating database breach risks</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p class="important-notice"><strong>BEST SECURITY IS NO DATA:</strong> Our security strategy is simple - we don't collect or store personal information, so there's nothing to lose in a data breach.</p>
